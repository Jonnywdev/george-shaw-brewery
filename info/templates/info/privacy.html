                We may also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. 
                Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this 
                data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage 
                Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, 
                if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or 
                indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in 
                accordance with this Policy.
                <br><br>
                We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you, including details about your race or

                <br><br>
                It is important that the Personal Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep up informed 
                if your Personal Data changes during your relationship with us.
                <br><br>
                <b>If you fail to provide Personal Data</b>
                <br><br>
                Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, 
                and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we 
                have or are trying to enter into with you. For example, when you initially engage with our services 
                but you do not provide relevant identification documents that would allow us to comply with anti-money 
                laundering checks, we may refuse to carry out our services to you. In such cases, we will notify 
                you at the time.

                <li>from time to time, to contact you for market research purposes, by email, phone, fax or mail;</li>
                <li>to administer and protect our business and this website (including troubleshooting, data analysis, 
                    testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data);</li>
                <li>to use data analytics to improve our website, products and/or services, marketing, customer relationships and experiences;</li>
                <li>to make suggestions and recommendations to you about goods or services that may be of interest to you; and</li>
                <li>to deliver relevant website content and advertisements to you and measure or understand the effectiveness of the advertising we serve to you.</li>
            </ul>

                and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how 
                the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. 
                If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will 
                explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

                <b>Third Party Transfers</b>
                <br><br>
                We may have to share your Personal Data with third parties:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>IT and system administration service providers acting as processors;</li>
                <li>Service providers who assist and support George Shaw Brewery with running our website or other IT services;</li>
                <li>Payment services providers;</li>
                <li>Some of our consultants and lawyers, as well as professional advisers acting as processors or joint

            </ul>
            <p>
                This may involve transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your 
                Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing at 
                least one of the following safeguards:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate 
                    level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission.</li>
                <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission 
                    which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
                <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield 
                    which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between Europe and the US.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We may also have to share your Personal Data for the above purposes with third parties to whom we may 
                choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to 
                acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners 
                may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Policy.
                <br><br>
                <b>How we use your Personal Data</b>
                <br><br>
                We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal 
                Data in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, or 
                    to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract;</li>
                <li>where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and 
                    fundamental rights do not override those interests. We make sure we consider and balance any potential 
                    impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our 
                    legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden 
                    by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). 
                    You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential 
                    impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us; and</li>
                <li>where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your Personal Data other than in relation 
                to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email, phone, fax or mail.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be

                information indefinitely without further notice to you.
                <br><br>

                We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we 
                think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, 
                services and offers may be relevant to you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing 
                communications from us if you have requested information from us, purchased goods or services from us, 
                signed up to our newsletters or blogs, provided us with your details when you entered a competition or 
                registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. 
                You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
                <br><br>
                You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time. 
                Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to Personal Data 
                provided to us as a result of a service purchase, service experience or other transactions.
                <br><br>
                <b>Exercising your rights</b>
                <br><br>
                As a data subject, you have the following rights under the GDPR, which this Policy and our use of 
                Personal Data have been designed to uphold:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the right to be informed about our collection and use of Personal Data;</li>
                <li>the right of access to the Personal Data we hold about you;</li>
                <li>the right to rectification if any Personal Data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete;</li>
                <li>the right to be forgotten - i.e. the right to ask us to delete any Personal Data we hold about you;</li>
                <li>the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data;</li>
                <li>the right to data portability - i.e. obtaining a copy of your Personal Data to re-use with another service or organisation;</li>
                <li>the right to object to us using your Personal Data for particular purposes; and</li>
                <li>rights with respect to automated decision making and profiling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us. Please note that we may need to request 
                specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your 
                Personal Data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that 
                Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact 
                you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
                <br><br>
                You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). 
                However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. 
                Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
                <br><br>
                We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than 
                a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, 
                we will notify you and keep you updated.
                <br><br>
                If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your Personal Data, please contact us and we 
                will do our best to solve the problem for you. If we are unable to help, you also have the right to 
                lodge a complaint with the UK's supervisory authority for data protection issues, 
                the Information Commissioner's Office (www.ico.org.uk).
